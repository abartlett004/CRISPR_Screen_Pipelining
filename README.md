# CRISPR_Screen_Pipelining
Selected code from a pipeline I wrote for analyzing NGS data from screens using pooled CRISPR guides. The parts I have included here are the master Snakefile, the Python wrapper script that wrangles the Snakefile's arguments and starts the pipeline, and an R script I created for generating input files for one of the steps of the pipeline.
